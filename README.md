## Usage
1. Activity#onCreate  
    An LifecycleObserver that can overlay a PrivacyView when the Activity moves to the background. This class must **initialize after Activity#setContentView()**.  
    You can set the layout that covers the activity.
    ```kotlin
      // setContentView() exists before
      privacyObserver = PrivacyObserver(this, R.layout.activity_splash)
      lifecycle.addObserver(privacyObserver)
    ```  
   
2. Activity#onUserLeaveHint  
    You have to override onUserLeaveHint. Because it cannot be monitored by Lifecycle Observer.   
    ```kotlin
      override fun onUserLeaveHint() {
        super.onUserLeaveHint()
        // need call
        privacyObserver.onUserLeaveHint()
      }
    ```
